        "### **Key Features of MongoDB:**\n",
        "- **Schema-less Structure** – No predefined schema, allowing flexibility.\n",
        "- **Document-Based Storage** – Uses collections and documents instead of tables and rows.\n",
        "- **Scalability** – Supports horizontal scaling using **sharding**.\n",

        "## **What are Non-Relational Databases?**  \n",
        "Non-relational databases, also known as **NoSQL databases**, store data in formats other than traditional tables. They include:\n",
        "- **Document Stores** (e.g., MongoDB, CouchDB) – Store data as JSON/BSON documents.\n",
        "- **Key-Value Stores** (e.g., Redis, DynamoDB) – Store data as key-value pairs.\n",
        "- **Column-Family Stores** (e.g., Cassandra, HBase) – Store data in column-based storage.\n",

        "\n",
        "## **Key Features of MongoDB:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Document-Oriented Storage**  \n",
        "   MongoDB stores data in flexible, self-contained **documents** using the **BSON** (Binary JSON) format. Each document can store various types of data, including arrays and embedded documents, allowing for more complex data structures.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - **Benefit:** Data can be stored in a way that reflects real-world entities, such as user profiles or orders, making it easier to model real-world scenarios.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Scalability**  \n",
        "   MongoDB provides **horizontal scaling** through **sharding**, meaning it can distribute large amounts of data across multiple servers, ensuring that performance remains optimal even as the database grows.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - **Benefit:** MongoDB can handle large volumes of data, making it suitable for applications that require scalability, such as social networks and IoT.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **High Availability**  \n",
        "   MongoDB ensures high availability of data using **replication**. It can automatically replicate data to multiple servers (called **replica sets**), so if one server goes down, another can take over without data loss.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - **Benefit:** This feature ensures continuous availability and helps prevent downtime.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Flexible Schema**  \n",
        "   MongoDB is **schema-less**, meaning each document in a collection can have different fields and structures. This allows for dynamic changes in the data model without the need for schema migration or downtime.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - **Benefit:** It offers flexibility, allowing rapid development and evolution of applications without the constraints of a fixed schema.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Indexing**  \n",
        "   MongoDB supports **indexes** to improve the speed and performance of query execution. You can index fields to optimize search and retrieval operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - **Benefit:** Indexing makes queries faster, especially when dealing with large datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Aggregation Framework**  \n",
        "   MongoDB provides a powerful **aggregation framework** for performing complex data processing, such as filtering, sorting, grouping, and transforming data.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - **Benefit:** It allows for more advanced queries and calculations, similar to SQL's `GROUP BY` and `JOIN` operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Rich Query Language**  \n",
        "   MongoDB supports a rich query language that can perform complex queries, including filters, sorting, and projection (selecting specific fields).\n",
        "\n",
        "   - **Benefit:** This allows developers to query the database using a variety of conditions, making MongoDB highly versatile.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **Ad Hoc Queries**  \n",
        "   MongoDB supports **ad hoc queries**, meaning that you can run queries on the fly without needing to define them in advance.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - **Benefit:** This allows for greater flexibility in querying data and quickly fetching the needed information.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "9. **Geospatial Indexing**  \n",
        "   MongoDB supports **geospatial indexes**, allowing you to store and query location-based data, such as latitude and longitude, for applications like maps, GPS, and location-based services.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - **Benefit:** Useful for applications involving mapping, location tracking, and geographic data analysis.\n",

        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "10. **GridFS for Large Files**  \n",

        "\n",
        "    - **Benefit:** It allows you to store large binary files and access them efficiently, making MongoDB ideal for media-heavy applications.\n",

        "   - If MongoDB is not running locally or uses a different port, you would need to adjust the connection string accordingly.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **`client[\"mydatabase\"]`**  \n",
        "   - This command connects to a database called `mydatabase`. If `mydatabase` doesn't already exist, MongoDB will create it as soon as you insert data.\n",
        "   - The `client` object is used to access and interact with databases on the connected MongoDB server.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **`db[\"customers\"]`**  \n",
        "   - This creates (or connects to) a collection called `customers` within the `mydatabase` database.\n",
        "   - A **collection** in MongoDB is like a **table** in a relational database. Collections hold the actual data and are stored in a database.\n",
        "   - If the `customers` collection doesn't exist, MongoDB will create it when data is inserted.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **`collection.insert_one(customer)`**  \n",
        "   - This line inserts a single document (record) into the `customers` collection. In this case, the document is a Python dictionary with fields `name` and `address`.\n",
        "   - **Document** in MongoDB is like a **row** in SQL but is more flexible, storing data in a key-value format.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **`collection.find_one({\"name\": \"Alice\"})`**  \n",
        "   - This command retrieves the document where the `name` field equals \"Alice\". It returns the first matching document.\n",
        "   - This method helps verify that the document has been successfully inserted into the collection.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **`client.close()`**  \n",
        "   - Once all operations are complete, it's a good practice to close the connection to MongoDB using `client.close()`.\n",
        "   - This ensures that resources are freed up and no more operations are pending.\n",
