        "### Answer:\n",
        "**Bokeh** is a powerful Python library for creating interactive visualizations and plots in web browsers. It is particularly useful for visualizing large datasets and creating interactive dashboards. To create a Bokeh plot, you can follow these basic steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Import necessary libraries**: we need to import `figure` from `bokeh.plotting` to create a plot.\n",
        "2. **Create a plot**: Use the `figure()` function to define your plot, where you can customize various attributes (such as title, axes labels, etc.).\n",
        "3. **Add glyphs**: A glyph represents a visual element (line, circle, bar, etc.) to plot the data. For example, use `circle()`, `line()`, etc., to add different types of plots.\n",
        "4. **Show the plot**: Use the `show()` function to display the plot in a browser."
