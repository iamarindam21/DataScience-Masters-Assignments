        "\n",
        "1. **Random Sampling**:\n",
        "   - The data should be collected through **random sampling**. Each sample should be selected independently from the population to ensure that the sample is representative and unbiased.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Sample Size**:\n",
        "   - For the CLT to hold, the sample size should be sufficiently large. While there is no strict rule, a common guideline is that the sample size should be at least **30**. In some cases, smaller sample sizes may suffice, especially if the population distribution is roughly normal.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Independence of Observations**:\n",

        "\n",
        "4. **Finite Variance**:\n",
        "   - The population from which the sample is drawn must have a **finite variance** (i.e., it should not have infinite variance or extreme outliers). This ensures that the sample means are well-behaved and converge to a normal distribution.\n",
