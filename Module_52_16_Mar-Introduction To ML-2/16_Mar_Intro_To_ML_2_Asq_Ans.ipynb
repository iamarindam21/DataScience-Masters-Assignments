        "Dropout is a regularization technique commonly used in deep learning models. During training, randomly selected neurons (or units) are \"dropped out,\" meaning their output is ignored for that particular iteration. This prevents the model from becoming overly reliant on any one neuron and forces it to learn more robust features.\n",

        "Early stopping involves monitoring the model’s performance on a **validation set** during training. When the model’s performance on the validation set starts to deteriorate (indicating overfitting), training is stopped early, preventing the model from learning the noise in the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **How it Helps:**\n",
        "- Prevents overfitting by halting training before the model starts memorizing the noise in the training data.\n",

        "Regularization is a key technique for preventing overfitting in machine learning. By penalizing large weights or introducing randomness, regularization techniques like **L1**, **L2**, **Elastic Net**, **Dropout**, and **Early Stopping** help models generalize better to unseen data. The choice of regularization method depends on the model and the dataset characteristics, such as the number of features and the presence of correlated features.\n",
