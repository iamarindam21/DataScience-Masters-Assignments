        "1. **Decision Trees** (e.g., CART, Random Forests, XGBoost)\n",

While some machine learning algorithms like Decision Trees, KNN, Naive Bayes, and certain gradient boosting methods can work with missing data, other algorithms might require imputation or deletion to handle missing values effectively.\n",
