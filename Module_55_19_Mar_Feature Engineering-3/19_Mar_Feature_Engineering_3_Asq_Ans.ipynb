        "**Min-Max scaling**, also known as **Normalization**, is a technique used to transform the features of a dataset into a specific range, typically between 0 and 1. This scaling method ensures that the features contribute equally to the model's performance by preventing certain features with larger ranges from dominating the learning process. Min-Max scaling is particularly useful for algorithms that rely on distance measures, such as **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** and **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**.\n",

        "**Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** is a statistical technique used for dimensionality reduction, which helps to reduce the number of features (or variables) in a dataset while preserving as much variance (information) as possible. PCA is widely used in machine learning, data analysis, and visualization, especially when dealing with high-dimensional data.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Standardize the Data**:\n",
        "   - Since PCA is sensitive to the scale of the data, it is essential to standardize the dataset (e.g., using z-score normalization) so that all features have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.\n",

        "# **Relationship Between PCA and Feature Extraction**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** is a dimensionality reduction technique that can also be used for **feature extraction**. In feature extraction, we aim to transform the original features into a new set of features (usually fewer) that retain the essential information from the original dataset. PCA is one of the most popular methods for feature extraction because it identifies the principal components (directions of maximum variance) in the data and uses them to create new features.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Key Concepts**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Dimensionality Reduction**: PCA reduces the number of features in a dataset by selecting the most important features (principal components) that explain the majority of the variance in the data. This reduces the dimensionality of the dataset while preserving important patterns and relationships.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Feature Extraction**: In PCA, the new set of features is composed of **principal components**. These components are linear combinations of the original features. The principal components capture the directions of maximum variance in the data, making them new, more meaningful features for analysis and modeling.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **How PCA is Used for Feature Extraction**\n",
        "\n",
        "In feature extraction, PCA transforms the original features into a smaller set of new features (principal components) that can be used as inputs to machine learning models. The new features, or components, are ranked by the amount of variance they explain in the data, and we typically select the top principal components to form the new feature set.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Steps Involved in Using PCA for Feature Extraction**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Standardize the Data**:\n",
        "   - PCA is sensitive to the scale of the data, so it's important to standardize the dataset (e.g., mean = 0, variance = 1) before applying PCA.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Compute the Covariance Matrix**:\n",
        "   - The covariance matrix captures the relationships between the features in the dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Calculate the Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**:\n",
        "   - Eigenvalues represent the variance explained by each principal component, and eigenvectors represent the direction of these components.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Select the Top Principal Components**:\n",
        "   - Sort the eigenvalues in descending order, and select the top components that capture the most variance.\n",

        "1. **Standardize the Dataset**:  \n",

        "\n",
        "4. **Sort the Eigenvalues**:  \n",
        "   The eigenvalues are sorted in descending order, as they indicate the amount of variance captured by each principal component. The larger the eigenvalue, the more variance the principal component explains.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Select the Number of Principal Components to Retain**:  \n",
        "   The decision on how many principal components to retain is based on the **explained variance ratio**.\n",

        "- Look at the **cumulative explained variance** of the principal components.\n",
