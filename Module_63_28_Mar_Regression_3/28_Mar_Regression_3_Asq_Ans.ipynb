        "\n",
        "Ridge Regression is a regularized version of Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression and shares many of its assumptions. However, the regularization helps mitigate some of the issues faced by OLS. The key assumptions of Ridge Regression are:\n",
        "\n",
        "### **1. Linearity**\n",
        "- The relationship between the independent variables (**X**) and the dependent variable (**y**) should be linear.\n",
        "- If the relationship is nonlinear, transformations or polynomial features may be needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **2. No Perfect Multicollinearity**\n",
        "- Unlike OLS, Ridge Regression can handle **multicollinearity** (high correlation between independent variables), but it still assumes that variables contribute useful information.\n",
        "- If there is perfect multicollinearity, Ridge will still regularize the coefficients but may not completely resolve the issue.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **3. Normally Distributed Errors (Optional)**\n",
        "- The residuals (errors) should ideally follow a **normal distribution** with a mean of zero.\n",
        "- This assumption is more critical for confidence intervals and hypothesis testing rather than model performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **4. Homoscedasticity (Constant Variance of Errors)**\n",
        "- The variance of residuals should remain **constant** across all levels of the independent variables.\n",
        "- If heteroscedasticity (non-constant variance) exists, transformations such as **logarithms** or **weighted regression** may be needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "###**5. No Auto-Correlation in Errors**\n",
        "- The residuals should not be correlated with each other, meaning that errors in one observation should not influence the next.\n",
        "- This assumption is especially important for **time-series data**. If violated, models like **ARIMA** or time-series regression should be considered.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **6. The Independent Variables Are Not Strongly Non-Linear**\n",
        "- Ridge Regression assumes that a **linear combination** of features is sufficient to describe the relationship between inputs and outputs.\n",

        "The value of λ is typically selected using **cross-validation**, following these steps:\n",
