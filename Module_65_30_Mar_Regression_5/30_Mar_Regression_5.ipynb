        "\n",
        "### **Elastic Net Regression**  \n",
        "Elastic Net is a **regularized regression technique** that combines **Ridge Regression (L2 penalty)** and **Lasso Regression (L1 penalty)**. It is useful when dealing with **high-dimensional data** and **multicollinearity**.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **How It Differs from Other Regression Techniques**\n",
        "1. **Combination of L1 and L2 Penalties:**  \n",
        "   - Unlike **Lasso**, which only applies L1 regularization (leading to feature selection), and **Ridge**, which applies only L2 regularization (shrinking coefficients), Elastic Net **blends both**.\n",
        "   - The regularization term is:  \n",
        "     \\[\n",
        "     \\lambda_1 \\sum | \\beta_j | + \\lambda_2 \\sum \\beta_j^2\n",
        "     \\]\n",
        "     where **λ1 (L1) controls sparsity** and **λ2 (L2) controls shrinkage**.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Handles Multicollinearity Better than Lasso:**  \n",
        "   - Lasso can randomly select one variable among correlated features, while Elastic Net distributes the effect across correlated variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Feature Selection with Grouping Effect:**  \n",
        "   - Unlike Lasso, which may select only one feature from a group of correlated variables, Elastic Net tends to **select all or none**.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **More Stable in High-Dimensional Data:**  \n",
