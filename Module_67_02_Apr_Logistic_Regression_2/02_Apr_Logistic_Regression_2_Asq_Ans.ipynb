        "### **Purpose of Grid Search CV**\n",
        "Grid Search Cross-Validation (Grid Search CV) is used to **find the optimal hyperparameters** for a machine learning model. It systematically searches through a predefined set of hyperparameters to determine the best combination that improves model performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **How It Works**\n",
        "1. **Define the Hyperparameter Grid**  \n",
        "   - Specify the range of hyperparameter values to test (e.g., different values of learning rate, regularization strength, or tree depth).\n",
        "  \n",
        "2. **Perform Cross-Validation**  \n",
        "   - The dataset is split into multiple training and validation subsets using **k-fold cross-validation**.\n",
        "   - For each combination of hyperparameters, the model is trained on training folds and evaluated on validation folds.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Evaluate Performance**  \n",
        "   - The average performance metric (e.g., accuracy, RMSE, F1-score) is calculated for each combination.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Select the Best Hyperparameters**  \n",
        "   - The combination that gives the best performance is chosen for the final model.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Advantages of Grid Search CV**\n",
        "- Ensures a systematic and thorough search for the best hyperparameters.\n",
        "- Uses cross-validation to prevent overfitting.\n",

        "- Always split the dataset into **training**, **validation**, and **test sets** before performing any data transformations such as scaling or imputation.\n",

        "### **3. Be Careful with Feature Engineering**\n",
        "- Avoid creating features that indirectly use the target variable.\n",
        "- Example: In a credit risk prediction model, a feature like **“Late Payment in Next 3 Months”** would leak future information.\n",

        "### **4. Use Pipelines for Data Processing**\n",
        "- Implement **scikit-learn Pipelines** to ensure transformations such as **scaling**, **encoding**, and **imputation** are applied only on the training set and then used on the test set.\n",

        "\n",
        "### **5. Perform Cross-Validation Correctly**\n",
        "- Use **K-Fold Cross-Validation** where data is split into different subsets for training and validation to check for overfitting.\n",
        "- Ensure feature engineering is performed **inside each fold**, not before splitting.\n",

        "### **6. Monitor High Feature Correlations**\n",
        "- If a feature is highly correlated with the target variable, verify that it doesn’t contain direct information about the target.\n",
