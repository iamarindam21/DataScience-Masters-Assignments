        "\n",
        "## **Explanation**\n",
        "Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating) reduces overfitting in decision trees by leveraging **random resampling and averaging predictions**. Here's how:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Creates Multiple Subsets of Data**  \n",
        "   - Bagging generates multiple training datasets by **randomly sampling with replacement** from the original dataset.  \n",
        "   - Each subset is slightly different, introducing variability.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Trains Multiple Decision Trees**  \n",
        "   - Each decision tree is trained on a different bootstrap sample.  \n",
        "   - Since individual decision trees tend to overfit the training data, training them on different samples **reduces the variance**.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Aggregates Predictions (Averaging or Majority Voting)**  \n",
        "   - For **classification problems**, bagging uses **majority voting** (most common prediction across trees).  \n",
        "   - For **regression problems**, bagging **averages** the predictions from all trees.  \n",
        "   - This aggregation smooths out noise and **reduces variance**, making the model more **generalizable**.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Why Does This Reduce Overfitting?**\n",
        "- **Reduces variance**: Overfitting occurs when a model is too sensitive to small fluctuations in training data. Bagging creates diverse models, reducing over-reliance on specific training examples.\n",
        "- **Smooths predictions**: Since predictions are averaged, extreme values (outliers) have less influence.\n",
        "- **Less sensitivity to noise**: Decision trees are highly sensitive to small changes in data, but bagging helps stabilize predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Conclusion**\n",
        "Bagging improves **stability and accuracy** while reducing **overfitting** by combining multiple decision trees trained on different subsets of data. This results in a more **robust and generalized** model.\n"
