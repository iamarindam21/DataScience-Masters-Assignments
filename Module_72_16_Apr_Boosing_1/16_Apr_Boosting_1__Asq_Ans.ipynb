        "1. **Higher Accuracy**: Boosting combines weak learners to create a strong model, improving predictive performance.\n",
        "2. **Reduces Bias and Variance**: It minimizes both bias (by refining weak models) and variance (by aggregating multiple models).\n",

        "1. **Prone to Overfitting**: If not regularized, boosting can overfit to noise in the training data.\n",
        "2. **Computationally Expensive**: Sequential training makes it slower compared to parallelizable methods like bagging.\n",
        "3. **Sensitive to Noisy Data**: Misclassified noisy data points get higher weights, which can degrade performance.\n",
        "4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Requires careful tuning of parameters like learning rate, number of estimators, and tree depth.\n",

        "## **Effect of Increasing the Number of Estimators in AdaBoost**\n",
        "\n",
        "The number of estimators (\\( T \\)), or weak learners, in AdaBoost plays a crucial role in determining the model's performance. Hereâs how increasing \\( T \\) affects AdaBoost:\n",
        "\n",
        "### **1. Improved Performance (Up to a Point)**\n",
        "- As \\( T \\) increases, the ensemble model becomes stronger by reducing bias.\n",
        "- More weak learners allow the model to refine its decision boundary and correct misclassifications from previous iterations.\n",
        "- Generally, adding more estimators improves performance **until a saturation point**.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **2. Risk of Overfitting**\n",
        "- Unlike other boosting methods, AdaBoost is relatively **resistant to overfitting**, especially when using simple weak learners (e.g., decision stumps).\n",
        "- However, with too many estimators, the model may start memorizing the training data, leading to **overfitting**, especially on noisy datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **3. Increased Computational Cost**\n",
        "- Training more weak learners increases computational time and memory usage.\n",
        "- This can be a concern for large datasets or when using complex base learners.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **4. Diminishing Returns**\n",
        "- Beyond a certain number of estimators, the performance gain becomes marginal.\n",
        "- After this point, adding more weak learners **does not significantly improve accuracy** but increases computational cost.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **5. Handling Noisy Data**\n",
        "- If the dataset contains **noise or mislabeled samples**, increasing \\( T \\) can cause AdaBoost to focus too much on these misclassified samples.\n",
        "- This can **degrade generalization** and reduce test accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, increasing the number of estimators in AdaBoost can enhance model performance, but excessive estimators can lead to overfitting and increased computation time.\n"
